Installation Walkthrough
------------------------
1. Install a Linux distribution that supports a Desktop Environment.

2. cd into the directory this archive is cloned or copied into and type the following commands:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

3. In your Desktop Environments Appearance Settings select the a cursor theme then apply and logout.

4. If your cursors haven't changed and you're by chance running Compiz Reloaded, in CCSM General Settings, type in the name of the cursor theme.

Should you choose to uninstall one or all of these cursor themes, for now this can be done by cding into the /usr/share/icons directory and searching for folders to delete with the tag _Cursors.
